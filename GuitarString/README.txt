Guitar String was very difficult to implement. The sample and the time functions were the easiest to implement. In the first constructor, it creates a guitar string with the frequency of 44100 which is the frequency of the human ear. It uses the enqueue function from RingBuffer to create it. In the second constructor, it gives the initial and size values of the vector. Using the size and enqueue functions from RingBuffer it creates the size and the initial values. In the pluck function, it plucks the guitar by replacing the buffer with random values. By using rand() it creates random values between -32768 to 32767. In the tic function, it simulates 1 step at a time. It first dequeues the first value and then finds the peek. Then I applied the Karplus-Strong update to the enqueue. And the last two functions return the sample and the number of times tic called.
