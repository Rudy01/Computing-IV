*  Discussion (important)
*  About what you didâ€”at least 100 words (what you actually implemented)
   In this project we had to implement the Sierpinski Triangle. I used three different files to implement the Sierpinski Triangle. The main.cpp draws the triangle. sierpinski.hpp has the class defined from the PowerPoint. In the sierpinski.cpp defines the functions in the class. In the first constructor I assigned some variables and using the midpoint formula I set the points for the triangles. In the second constructor I used the midpoint formula to set the filled triangles points. In the draw function I drew the triangle. First I set the points of the outside triangle then set the points for the upside-down triangles.
